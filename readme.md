# WordPress Multisite Headless CMS

This project is hosted on GitHub and can be found at the following repository: [WordPress Multisite CMS](https://github.com/barrytickle/wordpress-multisite-cms).

## Overview

This is a multisite headless WordPress setup. It allows you to manage multiple WordPress sites from a single installation, while using WordPress as a backend content management system (CMS) and serving the content through a separate frontend application.

## Features

- **Multisite Management**: Easily manage multiple WordPress sites from a single dashboard.
- **Headless CMS**: Use WordPress purely as a backend CMS, decoupling the frontend for more flexibility and performance.
- **REST API**: Leverage the WordPress REST API to fetch content and deliver it to your frontend application.
